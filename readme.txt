It's not much, but it's an honest job....

1. Install Python language on your computer;
2. Create a new virtual environment;
3. Install the library versions necessary for the program to work from the requirements.txt file into your virtual environment;
4. Run the script make_tables.py to create a database file and all the necessary tables;
5. Install the necessary Qt5 dependencies to run the program: apt install qt5-default
6. Run the main program file: main.py
7. The database.db file contains a film library, tables of new movie rentals and users are blank.

Enjoy the work of the programm
